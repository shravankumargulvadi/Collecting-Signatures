# Collecting-Signatures
You are responsible for collecting signatures from all tenants of a certain building. For each tenant, you know a period of time when he or she is at home. You would like to collect all signatures by visiting the building as few times as possible. The mathematical model for this problem is the following. You are given a set of segments on a line and your goal is to mark as few points on a line as possible so that each segment contains at least one marked point.
