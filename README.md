# Collecting-Signatures
You are responsible for collecting signatures from all tenants of a certain building. For each tenant, you know a period of time when he or she is at home. You would like to collect all signatures by visiting the building as few times as possible. The mathematical model for this problem is the following. You are given a set of segments on a line and your goal is to mark as few points on a line as possible so that each segment contains at least one marked point.

Problem Description
Task. Given a set of 𝑛 segments {[𝑎0, 𝑏0], [𝑎1, 𝑏1], . . . , [𝑎𝑛−1, 𝑏𝑛−1]} with integer coordinates on a line, find
the minimum number 𝑚 of points such that each segment contains at least one point. That is, find a
set of integers 𝑋 of the minimum size such that for any segment [𝑎𝑖, 𝑏𝑖] there is a point 𝑥 ∈ 𝑋 such
that 𝑎𝑖 ≤ 𝑥 ≤ 𝑏𝑖.
